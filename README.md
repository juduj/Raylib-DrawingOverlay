# Raylib-DrawingOverlay
Raylib-DrawingOverlay is a project for anyone who wants to draw on top most with mouse pass-through.

# Must have a Windows operating system for this to work
You have to be on windows for this too work as of right now it uses windows functions to make the window pass through and top most. 
It is possible to get this to work on linux if you can figure out linux functions to make this work. 
For now I wont implement it since it's very little and shouldn't be too hard to do by yourself.
